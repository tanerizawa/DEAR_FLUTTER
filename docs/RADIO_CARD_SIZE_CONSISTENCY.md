# Radio Card Size Consistency Fix

## Overview
Fixed inconsistency in radio station card sizes across different sections of the application to ensure a uniform design and better user experience.

## Problem
Radio station cards in the `unified_media_section.dart` had different dimensions compared to the radio station cards in `enhanced_radio_section.dart`, creating visual inconsistency in the UI.

## Changes Made

### 1. unified_media_section.dart
**File:** `lib/presentation/home/widgets/unified_media_section.dart`

#### ListView Container Height
**Before:**
```dart
SizedBox(
  height: 130,
  child: ListView.builder(
    // ...
  ),
),
```

**After:**
```dart
SizedBox(
  height: 140,
  child: ListView.builder(
    // ...
  ),
),
```

#### Individual Radio Card Dimensions
**Before:**
```dart
Widget _buildRadioStationCard(BuildContext context, RadioStation station) {
  return Container(
    width: 100,
    height: 110,
    margin: const EdgeInsets.only(right: 12),
    // ...
  );
}
```

**After:**
```dart
Widget _buildRadioStationCard(BuildContext context, RadioStation station) {
  return Container(
    width: 120,
    height: 140,
    margin: const EdgeInsets.only(right: 12),
    // ...
  );
}
```

### 2. Reference Standard
**File:** `lib/presentation/home/widgets/enhanced_radio_section.dart`

The enhanced radio section already used the correct dimensions:
- ListView height: `140px`
- Card width: `120px` (implied by aspect ratio)
- Card height: `140px`

## Results

### Before
- Enhanced Radio Section: 140px height cards
- Unified Media Section: 130px height container, 110px height cards with 100px width
- **Inconsistency:** Different card sizes across sections

### After
- Enhanced Radio Section: 140px height cards
- Unified Media Section: 140px height container, 140px height cards with 120px width
- **Consistent:** All radio station cards now have uniform dimensions

## Design Benefits

1. **Visual Consistency:** All radio station cards now have the same size across different sections
2. **Better Touch Targets:** Larger card size (120x140px) provides better user interaction
3. **Improved Layout:** Consistent spacing and proportions throughout the app
4. **Maintainability:** Single standard size for all radio cards makes future updates easier

## Files Modified
- `lib/presentation/home/widgets/unified_media_section.dart`

## Files Referenced
- `lib/presentation/home/widgets/enhanced_radio_section.dart` (used as size standard)

## Testing
- ✅ Flutter analysis passed without new errors
- ✅ App builds and runs successfully
- ✅ Hot reload works correctly
- ✅ Radio cards display with consistent sizing

## Standard Dimensions for Future Reference

### Radio Station Cards
- **Width:** 120px
- **Height:** 140px  
- **Container Height:** 140px (for horizontal ListView)
- **Margin:** 12px right spacing between cards

These dimensions should be used for all radio station card implementations across the application.
