## 📊 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Enhanced Search System**
```dart
// Multi-criteria filtering with enum-based options
enum JournalSortOption { dateNewest, dateOldest, moodHappy, moodSad, contentLength }
enum DateRangeFilter { all, today, week, month, year }

// Immutable filter state with copyWith pattern
class JournalSearchFilters {
  final String searchQuery;
  final List<String> selectedMoods;
  final DateRangeFilter dateRange;
  final JournalSortOption sortOption;
  
  bool get hasActiveFilters => /* smart detection logic */;
  int get activeFilterCount => /* count active filters */;
}
```

### **Analytics Engine**
```dart
// Comprehensive analytics calculation
class JournalAnalytics {
  final Map<String, int> moodCounts;
  final List<MoodEntry> moodHistory;
  final int currentStreak;
  final int longestStreak;
  final double averageEntriesPerWeek;
  final List<String> insights; // AI-generated insights
}
```

### **Animation System**
```dart
// Multi-controller animation setup
late AnimationController _scaleController;
late AnimationController _glowController;
late Animation<double> _glowAnimation;

// Breathing effect for selected mood
_glowController.repeat(reverse: true);
```
