# Unified Media Player Height Consistency

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to ensure all media player components have consistent heights of 140px, matching the radio station selector height.

## Changes Made

### 1. Music Player Height
**File**: `lib/presentation/home/widgets/unified_media_section.dart`
- **Before**: Container with constraints `minHeight: 300, maxHeight: 400`
- **After**: Fixed `height: 140`
- **Location**: `_buildMusicPlayer()` method

### 2. Radio Player Height  
**File**: `lib/presentation/home/widgets/unified_media_section.dart`
- **Before**: Container with constraints `minHeight: 300, maxHeight: 400` with Column layout
- **After**: Fixed `height: 140` with compact header layout
- **Location**: `_buildRadioPlayer()` method

### 3. Radio Station Selector Height
**File**: `lib/presentation/home/widgets/unified_media_section.dart`
- **Status**: Already correctly set to `height: 140`
- **Location**: `_buildRadioStationSelector()` method

## Benefits

1. **Visual Consistency**: All media player components now have the same height
2. **Better Layout**: More compact and organized UI
3. **Improved UX**: Consistent interaction patterns across different media types
4. **Space Efficiency**: Better use of screen real estate

## Implementation Details

### Music Player
```dart
return Container(
  height: 140,
  child: UnifiedMediaPlayer(
    // ... player configuration
  ),
);
```

### Radio Player  
```dart
return Column(
  children: [
    // Compact header with back button
    Row(
      children: [
        IconButton(/* compact back button */),
        // ... title
      ],
    ),
    const SizedBox(height: 8),
    // Fixed height player
    Container(
      height: 140,
      child: UnifiedMediaPlayer(
        // ... radio configuration
      ),
    ),
  ],
);
```

### Radio Station Selector
```dart
SizedBox(
  height: 140,
  child: ListView.builder(
    // ... station cards
  ),
)
```

## Testing

- ✅ App builds successfully

- ✅ Preserved functionality for music and radio playback

## Files Modified

1. `lib/presentation/home/widgets/unified_media_section.dart`
   - Modified `_buildMusicPlayer()` method
   - Modified `_buildRadioPlayer()` method
   - Simplified radio player layout for compact design
